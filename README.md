## Objective

* Alongside leetcode, I'm also doing CodeSignal challenges ‚öôÔ∏è
* Python is the first language I'm doing these questions in but I hope to expand into other languages üêç
* Lastly, each solution file has different ways of doing the same questions from brute force to more elegant methods üîÅ
